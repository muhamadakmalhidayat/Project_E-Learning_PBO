## ⚠️ Database Requirements (IMPORTANT)

This application **must use a MySQL database**. Without the database, the application will not run.

    Get the required database file via this link:
    👉 **[Access Database (Google Drive)](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/15DjpqCIdEy0w1yQQ5s5CsKpRQcD8XPxk?usp=sharing)**

2.  **Import Database:**

    - Create a new database in MySQL named `pbo_elearning`.
    - Import the downloaded SQL file into that database.

3.  **Configure Connection:**
    Ensure the settings in `src/main/java/config/DatabaseConnection.java` match your MySQL configuration:
    ```java
    config.setJdbcUrl("jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/pbo_elearning");
    config.setUsername("root"); // change according to your database username
    config.setPassword(""); // change according to your database password
    ```

    git clone [https://github.com/maulaibrahimsyahwi/pbo-e-learning.git](https://github.com/maulaibrahimsyahwi/pbo-e-learning.git)
    ```

2.  **Open Project:**
    Open the project folder using your preferred IDE (VS Code, IntelliJ IDEA, or NetBeans) as a **Maven Project**.

3.  **Run:**
    Locate and run the main file: `src/main/java/app/App.java`.
